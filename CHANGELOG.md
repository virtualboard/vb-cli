## [v0.1.0] - 2025-01-27

### Added

- New `vb upgrade` command that automatically checks for newer versions on GitHub releases and upgrades the binary

- Comprehensive test coverage for the upgrade functionality including mock tests and integration tests
- Updated CLI documentation with detailed upgrade command reference and platform support information

### Changed

- Updated README.md to include upgrade command in key capabilities and usage examples
- Enhanced CLI reference documentation with upgrade command details and platform support information

### Fixed

- Improved release process robustness by ensuring tag names always match code version

## [v0.0.3] - 2025-01-27

### Fixed

- Fixed GitHub Actions release workflow to use version from code instead of tag name
- Corrected release tag mismatch issue where manual tags caused incorrect release names
- Improved release process robustness by extracting version from `internal/version/version.go`

### Changed

- Updated GitHub Actions workflows to release direct binary files instead of compressed archives (tar.gz/zip)

- Feature management tooling covering creation, updates, status transitions, dependency checks, validation, and indexing (Markdown/JSON/HTML).
- Development tooling: Makefile targets (`build`, `test`, `scan`, `package`), enforced 100% test coverage, gosec integration, and pre-commit hooks running security scans plus tests.
- Project documentation set (README, docs/CLI.md, docs/DEVELOPMENT.md, AGENTS.md) outlining usage, workflows, and automation guidance.
- Added Github Actions to build and release the vb cli
